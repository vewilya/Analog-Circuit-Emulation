# Analog-Circuit-Emulation
Analog Circuit Emulation with [ACME](https://github.com/HSU-ANT/ACME.jl) and [Julia](https://julialang.org)

This is just a short jupyter notebook, applying some if the basic circuit examples of a diode clipper and a sallenkey filter to a wave file - playing it back, as well as writing the outout to a file.

The circuit examples basically are straight out the ACME documentation.
